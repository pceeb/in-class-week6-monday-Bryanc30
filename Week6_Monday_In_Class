## In class exercise

1. If you wanted to reuse this program for a file that had 17 headers lines. What line of
 code would you change in our program?

        Write the line of code that you will replace here: if LineNumber > 0

        What will be the new code?

        Write the new code here: if LineNumber > 16

2. would happen if we don’t included `import sys` in our program?

        Write you answer here: If we don't include 'import sys' in our program, the
variables we set up in the script will be unidentifiable by the program, resulting
in some sort of error message saying it doesn't know what to do with it.

3. Let’s suppose that the third file that the user provides as input
has only one column. What error message will be generated?

        Write you answer here: The following error message will be displayed:
	"Line # not XY format in file #"

4. Our program split lines of input files (except the first file) into elements
that are tab delimitated. However, data could be split by `,` or many other
characters. In this case is a good idea to define a new variable that takes the delimiter
provide by the user. Using what you learn about `sys.argv` in this class`.
Write a variable that reads a delimiter (e.g ',') provided as the first input file.

        Write your code here: 
delim = sys.argv[1]
ElementList = Line.split('\delim')
